## Ingredients

* [Footwork: "The V-Step"](../01_techniques/01_footwork.md)
* [Kick: Front Leg Cut](../01_techniques/02_kicks.md) (also called "check kick" or "fast kick")
* [Kick: Back Kick](../01_techniques/02_kicks.md)

## Execution (The "Recipe")

1.  **The Setup:** Your opponent is moving *forward* into your space.
2.  **Step 1:** As they enter, throw a fast `Front Leg Cut Kick` to their chest. This is *not* a power kick. It's a "wall" to stop their momentum.
3.  **Step 2:** Land your kicking foot *forward* (or slightly to the side) from the cut kick.
4.  **Step 3:** As your opponent recovers from your "wall," immediately pivot and execute a `Back Kick`. They will often walk right into it.

## Common Mistakes

!!! failure "Mistake: Kicking Too Hard"
    Throwing the first cut kick with too much power. It makes you slow and off-balance for the back kick. **Think speed, not power.**

!!! warning "Mistake: Bad Landing"
    Landing your cut kick in the wrong place. If you land too close or too far, your back kick will have no power.
